# Vagrantfiles for WSO2 Identity Server

This section defines the procedure to execute run Vagrant resources for a setup of WSO2 Identity Server single
node with Analytics support.<br>

Please note that in order to run these Vagrant resources use, you need to install
[Oracle VM VirtualBox](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html),
as Vagrant uses Oracle VM VirtualBox as the default provider.
